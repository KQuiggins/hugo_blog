I ran into a problem when building my docker image for my flask_app. When installing the requirements.txt file it breaks when it gets to pyscopg2, I tried to install the pyscopg2-binary because that seemed to work on another project when I ran into a similar problem but that did not work. I also updated Ubuntu on my desktop computer and the Hugo server is not working properly after that update. I will continue to document my progress and these are all things that are learning experiences.
