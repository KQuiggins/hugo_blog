Working with JavaScript can be very frustrating sometimes, just ask anyone familiar with the language. Knowing how it works under the hood can shed light on a weird bug or issue you are having. So let's talk about hoisting.

What is Hoisting?

Hoisting is a term used to describe the behavior of JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes. This means that even if you declare a variable or function later in your code, it will be treated as if it was declared at the top of the scope.

For example:

```
console.log(x);
var x = 5;

```
At first glance, you might think that this code will result in an error since x is being used before it is declared. However, due to hoisting, the code is interpreted like this:

```
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 5;

```
As you can see, even though x is used before it is declared, it is still defined as a variable at the top of its scope.

Hoisting also works with function declarations. For example:

```
hello(); // "Hello, world!"

function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, Ken!");
}

```

You might think that would throw an error, but due to hoisting the code is interpreted like this:

```
function foo() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

foo(); // "Hello, world!"

```

Another important point to keep in mind is that hoisting only applies to the current scope. If a variable or function is declared inside a function, it will be hoisted to the top of that function's scope, but not to the global scope. Similarly, if a variable or function is declared inside a block (i.e., between curly braces), it will be hoisted to the top of the block's scope, but not to the surrounding function's scope.

Conclusion

Hoisting is a unique behavior in JavaScript that can sometimes be confusing. It moves variable and function declarations to the top of their respective scopes, which can lead to unexpected behavior if you are not aware of how it works. However, by understanding how hoisting works and its limitations, you can write more efficient and effective JavaScript code.

Hope this helps
Happy Coding!!!
