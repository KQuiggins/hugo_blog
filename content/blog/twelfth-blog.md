I was able to finally solve the Underdog Devs problem I was stuck on and I also solved the Hacker Rank problem I was stuck on. The UD problem I had to use nested loops which is something I need practice on though I am getting better at them the more I solve problems using them. The Hacker Rank problem I was stuck on I needed to use `self` in my power method of the Calculator `class` without `self` being in there you get an error saying `TypeError: Calculator.power() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`. Seems all I needed to do was walk away and get some rest to think on the issues I was having. HAPPY CODING!
