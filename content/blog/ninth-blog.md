School starts back up in one week I am excited and nervous about it.
I will have a lot more to write about once school starts up because I will be taking C# 2, Javascript, Security Fundamentals and writing 101. These are all classes that will make me a better developer so I am super excited to continue my coding journey and working with Carol on some new things and ideas that I will have.
