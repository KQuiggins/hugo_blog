Today I was able make make a request to a dictionary api to solve a problem in which I needed to find all the words that when spelled backwards are also acceptable scrabble words. Carol gave me the idea of the api during our meeting yesterday. Sometimes I have found you either need to walk away from the problem and sleep on it or get a fresh pair of eyes to help you solve it. I have also been talking to some people on twitter about programming in general and found someone that is familiar with .NET and C# and he is willing to meet with me to talk about it. So I am excited about expanding my network of people so we can help each other solve problems.
