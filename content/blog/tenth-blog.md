I was having to enter my personal access token everytime I push cjanges to GitHub when writing in my blog because I am using Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux so it is not recognizing it as my host machine so today I learned how to add an SSH key to my GitHub account and then use it to push changes to my blog. The process was pretty straight forward and I really had no problems with it. I still have had no luck with using adding CSS to the blog in my markdown files I tried every suggestion on Stack Overflow but I still had no luck to get it to work and read all documentation I could find.
