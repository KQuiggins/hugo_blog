I was able to get finally get the lab to accept my code. I learned how to create classes in C#, overload operators, and to have overloaded constructors. So far this chapter and set of labs have been the hardest and most challenging ones I have had. I have been working with Carol on editing my essay for my writing 101 class which is due on 9/10/22, writing is not one of my strengths. Hopefully this blog on my writing class will improve my writing skils.
