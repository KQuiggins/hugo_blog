I have been learning more about C# and Visual Studio now that school has started back up. I started working on a ASP.Net Web app which I needed to connect to a database. Since it is .NET I decided to use SQL Server + SQL Server Studio, because that is what is recommended in the documentation for building a ASP.Net application. I was able to get the server setup, create a database model in my app, and pull data from the database and display it on the webpage. Next I will start working on learning how to add data to the database from my application using C# and the .Net framework.
