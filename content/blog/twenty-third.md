I recently have been more active on Discord and what all the developers on twitter call "tech twitter". I found a Discord server for my school. Some students on there were asking for help with their programs and web pages. I decided to reach out to them and offer help. It really opened my eyes and helped me realize just how far I have come in my coding journey. One person had their paragraph element inside their description topic elements like this `<dt><p>Topic Here</p></dt>` and the lab would not accept the code. Another problem someone was having is they had the `src` for the images file set wrong, they had an uppercase I `Images/html5.jpg` instead of `images/html5.jpg`. I am glad I decided to reach and help some people, because people did the same for me and still do. It feels good to help others and help them learn while strengthening my own skills in the process.
