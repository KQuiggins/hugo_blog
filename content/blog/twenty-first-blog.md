I have been working on my essay in my writing 101 class, and Carol has been helping me alot on editing. I really have a long way to go on getting good at writing. My C# class has really gotten difficult all the sudden. I am having trouble with implementing operator overloading in one of my problems. For some reason I just can not get solve this problem. Hopefully after a good nights sleep it will come to me. I have added the link to my problem. [overloaded operators](https://github.com/KQuiggins/CIT_243_C-2/blob/16d83ad79ab40813927d235b8084c53d45f8c22a/SalesTransactionDemo/Program.cs#L44)
