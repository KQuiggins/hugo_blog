After the first week of being back to school, I have been able to get an idea of how the semester is going to go. I think it will go smooth, except for my writing class, which is a bunch of writing essays. I don't think I will fail because I am not a terrible writer, but I am not the best writer either. I really like my Javascript and C# classes. In both classes we are learning to write functions. In both classes it is a little more challenging than python. I am up for the challenge and really love to code and learn new things when it comes to programming.
