After the first week of being back to school I have been able to get an idea of how the semester is going to go and I think it will go smooth except for my writing class which is a bunch of writing essays I don't think I will fail because I am not a terrible writer but I am not the best writer either. I really like my Javascript and C# classes in both classes we are learning to write functions in both classes it is a little more challenging than python but I am up for the challenge and really love to code and learn new things when it comes to programming.
