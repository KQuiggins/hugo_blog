Heroku has decided to cancel their free tier service. This is very disappointing because I have apps hosted on their service. Because I am in school full time I can't afford to pay for a new service. I will be trying to migrate my apps to a new free platform soon, many people have shared a lot of good options for this. 

I have learned how open two files at the same time using python `with open("file1.txt", "r") as f1, open("file2.txt", "r") as f2:`. I have to loop through two files at once and print out all the top baby names in each file. I have also been learning more Javascript which I will write a blog post about soon.
