So far this week has been very frustrating. HP sent out a firmware update that makes you use brand new ink cartridges from them or your computer will not print. So basically I have a bunch of refurbished ink catridges I can't use and a printer I need and can't use. I was not able to get into 2 of my classes for two days because they are switching systems so it crashed a few things but it will all work out it just has been a mesh this week. On the bright side of things I am learning Javascript and C#, I am taking Security Fundamentals, and a writing class. The writing class will help with me writing in my blog also so I am happy about that. I just wanted to rant a little about my week even if it is into the void and no one reads it.
