Today I looked at my next problem to solve for 30 Days of Code on Hacker Rank and it is a Linked List problem this is all new to me and I am having a little trouble with it. I need to complete an insert functionso that it creates a new node and inserts it at the tail of the linked list refrenced by the head parameter. I think this will be the hardest problem to solve that I have had so far but after some research on the subject I am sure I will be able to solve it.
