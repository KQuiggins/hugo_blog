I was able to solve the linked list problem on hacker rank and it was nowhere near as hard as I thought it was going to be. Although the way they set the problem up was a little different than any problem I seen when researching how linked list work in python. I also am trying to network with people more that way I can get different perspectives on things and see how other people solve the same problem.
