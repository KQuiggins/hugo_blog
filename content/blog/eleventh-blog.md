I have been stuck on a problem for underdog devs practice problems for a few days I really wanted to figure this out on my own but I guess I am going to ask for help on this. The problem is "There is at least one country name that contains another country name. Find all of these cases." I know how to find a name that is contained in another string but for some reason I can not get the program to produce the correct output.
