Today I was able to write a C# program using `ref` keyword in my `Reverse4` method. This method takes in 4 parameters, all passing by reference, then reverses the order of the numbers. The program demostrates the ability of the `ref` keyword to make possible passing a reference of the memory location of the variable and actually changing the value of the original variable from the method. I was also able to debug a program that was using the `out` keyword and find and correct all logic and syntax errors.

I found a discord channel that has people in my school from CIT classes like me an I was able help a fellow student troubleshoot their JavaScript program that they could not get working. I was able to figure out they did not have an `onClick` event located on the button of their webpage. So when they clicked the button nothing happened. What should have happened when the button was clicked, `GetData()` method should have ran, collected the data, performed some calculations, and displayed it on the page.
