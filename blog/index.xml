I was able to go into the config file and make my changes and successfully connect to the database. I was also able to take the advice of my mentor and create a .</description></item><item><title>JavaScript and Security Fundamentals</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-sixth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 15:19:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-sixth/</guid><description>Today in my security fundamentals class, I learned about Organizational Units in Active Directory. I learned how to create groups of users and limit how long and what computer on the network they was able to use. This utilizes the Principle of Least Privledge approach. Only letting users have access to what is needed to complete the job.
I also learned how to use the XMLHttpRequest() method in JavaScript to pull data in from an API.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript map() function</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fifth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 19:05:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fifth/</guid><description>Today I learned about the JavaScript map() function. The map function is an important concept to learn if you want to master JavaScript. The map function works by mapping all elements in an array to a callback function and returns the results in an array. Here is an example of the map function:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const doubled = numbers.map(x =&amp;gt; x * 2); console.log(doubled); // returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Objects &amp; Prototypes</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fourth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 13:45:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fourth/</guid><description>Today I learned about JavaScript Objects &amp;amp; Prototypes. For intance if I create an object constructor like this:
function Student(firstName, lastName, id, scores){ *** constructor body goes here *** } I can create a method and add it to the objects prototype, so any object of that type would be able to use that method like so:
Student.prototype.getAverage = function(){ *** Function body goes here *** } I really like learning JavaScript, although I know I have just scratched the surface with what the language is capable of.</description></item><item><title>Helping Others</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-third/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 08:00:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-third/</guid><description>I recently have been more active on Discord and what all the developers on twitter call &amp;ldquo;tech twitter&amp;rdquo;. I found a Discord server for my school. Some students on there were asking for help with their programs and web pages. I decided to reach out to them and offer help. It really opened my eyes and helped me realize just how far I have come in my coding journey. One person had their paragraph element inside their description topic elements like this &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Topic Here&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt; and the lab would not accept the code.</description></item><item><title>Sales Transaction C#, Writing 101</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-second/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 20:06:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-second/</guid><description>I was able to get finally get the lab to accept my code. I learned how to create classes in C#, overload operators, and to have overloaded constructors. So far this chapter and set of labs have been the hardest and most challenging ones I have had. I have been working with Carol on editing my essay for my writing 101 class which is due on 9/10/22, writing is not one of my strengths.</description></item><item><title>C# Problems and Writing 101</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-first-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 21:52:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-first-blog/</guid><description>I have been working on my essay in my writing 101 class, and Carol has been helping me alot on editing. I really have a long way to go on getting good at writing. My C# class has really gotten difficult all the sudden. I am having trouble with implementing operator overloading in one of my problems. For some reason I just can not get solve this problem. Hopefully after a good nights sleep it will come to me.</description></item><item><title>C# and JavaScript Learning</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twentieth-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:47:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twentieth-blog/</guid><description>Today I was able to write a C# program using ref keyword in my Reverse4 method. This method takes in 4 parameters, all passing by reference, then reverses the order of the numbers. The program demostrates the ability of the ref keyword to make possible passing a reference of the memory location of the variable and actually changing the value of the original variable from the method. I was also able to debug a program that was using the out keyword and find and correct all logic and syntax errors.</description></item><item><title>Javascript sort function</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/nineteenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 16:37:14 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/nineteenth-blog/</guid><description>Today I learned about the javascript sort() function. It really acts weird when sorting an array with numbers that have more than one digit. It only sorts the first digit. For instance 100 would come befor 23. The way around this behavior is to pass a function to the sort() function. So it would look like this: val = numbers.sort(function(a, b) { return a - b; }); and it would sort the numbers from lowest to highest.</description></item><item><title>Heroku disappointment</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eighteenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 19:06:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eighteenth-blog/</guid><description>Heroku has decided to cancel their free tier service. This is very disappointing because I have apps hosted on their service. Because I am in school full time I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to pay for a new service. I will be trying to migrate my apps to a new free platform soon, many people have shared a lot of good options for this.
I have learned how open two files at the same time using python with open(&amp;quot;file1.</description></item><item><title>timer functions</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/seventeenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 20:59:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/seventeenth-blog/</guid><description>Today I used python timer module to run process_time() on my dictionary api request. I solved the same problem two different ways. One way using an list and the other using a set. I found the set way to be faster. After thinking about why I can see that a set should be faster because it uses hash tables and time shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the set is bigger or smaller. With a list the bigger the list is the longer it will take if you have to search through it.</description></item><item><title>Branching Out and Solving Problems</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/sixteenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 19:11:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/sixteenth-blog/</guid><description>Today I was able make make a request to a dictionary api to solve a problem in which I needed to find all the words that when spelled backwards are also acceptable scrabble words. Carol gave me the idea of the api during our meeting yesterday. Sometimes I have found you either need to walk away from the problem and sleep on it or get a fresh pair of eyes to help you solve it.</description></item><item><title>First week check-in</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fifteeth-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 15:02:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fifteeth-blog/</guid><description>After the first week of being back to school, I have been able to get an idea of how the semester is going to go. I think it will go smooth, except for my writing class, which is a bunch of writing essays. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will fail because I am not a terrible writer, but I am not the best writer either. I really like my Javascript and C# classes.</description></item><item><title>First week of School</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fourtenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 12:51:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fourtenth-blog/</guid><description>So far this week has been very frustrating. HP sent out a firmware update that makes you use brand new ink cartridges from them or your computer will not print. So basically I have a bunch of refurbished ink catridges I can&amp;rsquo;t use and a printer I need and can&amp;rsquo;t use. I was not able to get into 2 of my classes for two days because they are switching systems so it crashed a few things but it will all work out it just has been a mesh this week.</description></item><item><title>Summers Over</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirtenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 19:48:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirtenth-blog/</guid><description>Summer is finally over and it is time to go back to having deadlines and grade on programs. Although I am nervous I am excited also because I know I am investing in my future and the structure of school helps me focus. I have also been talking to a few different people online trying to expand my network and help in my journey.</description></item><item><title>unstuck and hackerank</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twelfth-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 07:33:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twelfth-blog/</guid><description>I was able to finally solve the Underdog Devs problem I was stuck on and I also solved the Hacker Rank problem I was stuck on. The UD problem I had to use nested loops which is something I need practice on though I am getting better at them the more I solve problems using them. The Hacker Rank problem I was stuck on I needed to use self in my power method of the Calculator class without self being in there you get an error saying TypeError: Calculator.</description></item><item><title>stuck</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eleventh-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 18:44:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eleventh-blog/</guid><description>I have been stuck on a problem for underdog devs practice problems for a few days I really wanted to figure this out on my own but I guess I am going to ask for help on this. The problem is &amp;ldquo;There is at least one country name that contains another country name. Find all of these cases.&amp;rdquo; I know how to find a name that is contained in another string but for some reason I can not get the program to produce the correct output.</description></item><item><title>SSH</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/tenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 06:56:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/tenth-blog/</guid><description>I was having to enter my personal access token everytime I push cjanges to GitHub when writing in my blog because I am using Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux so it is not recognizing it as my host machine so today I learned how to add an SSH key to my GitHub account and then use it to push changes to my blog. The process was pretty straight forward and I really had no problems with it.</description></item><item><title>Excited</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/ninth-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 11:45:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/ninth-blog/</guid><description>School starts back up in one week I am excited and nervous about it. I will have a lot more to write about once school starts up because I will be taking C# 2, Javascript, Security Fundamentals and writing 101. These are all classes that will make me a better developer so I am super excited to continue my coding journey and working with Carol on some new things and ideas that I will have.</description></item><item><title>Docker Database Migrations</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eighth-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 08:27:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eighth-blog/</guid><description>After finishing my docker-compose file to connect MySQL database to the flask app I ran into another problem with creating the database tables, I thought this would be a straight forward thing to do and apparently it is not from all the research I have done on the issue so far. I will continue to document everything I try, what works and what does not, hopefully it will help someone with similar issues.</description></item><item><title>Git Submodules</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/seventh-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 16:15:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/seventh-blog/</guid><description>Today I was able to fix both of my problems I was having. The first one with creating a docker image with my flask app I was able to use a different python image from docker hub that was not labeled with &amp;ldquo;-alpine&amp;rdquo;, after that the build went successfully. My second issue was not being able to serve my hugo blogs web pages locally, I was able to fix this by going into the themes folder and running &amp;ldquo;git submodule init&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;git submodule update&amp;rdquo; which this actually solves two problems for me now I can get to the themes files so I should be able to add some CSS and style some of my pages the way I want to.</description></item><item><title>docker build errors</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/sixth-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2022 15:48:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/sixth-blog/</guid><description>I ran into a problem when building my docker image for my flask_app. When installing the requirements.txt file it breaks when it gets to pyscopg2, I tried to install the pyscopg2-binary because that seemed to work on another project when I ran into a similar problem but that did not work. I also updated Ubuntu on my desktop computer and the Hugo server is not working properly after that update. I will continue to document my progress and these are all things that are learning experiences.</description></item><item><title>Learning new things</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fifth-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 12:30:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fifth-blog/</guid><description>I was able to solve the linked list problem on hacker rank and it was nowhere near as hard as I thought it was going to be. Although the way they set the problem up was a little different than any problem I seen when researching how linked list work in python. I also am trying to network with people more that way I can get different perspectives on things and see how other people solve the same problem.</description></item><item><title>Linked List</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fourth-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 20:40:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fourth-blog/</guid><description>Today I looked at my next problem to solve for 30 Days of Code on Hacker Rank and it is a Linked List problem this is all new to me and I am having a little trouble with it. I need to complete an insert functionso that it creates a new node and inserts it at the tail of the linked list refrenced by the head parameter. I think this will be the hardest problem to solve that I have had so far but after some research on the subject I am sure I will be able to solve it.</description></item><item><title>Certifications</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/third-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 18:52:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/third-blog/</guid><description>Today I added my certifications to my blog. I am trying to figure out how to add color to the text to kind of give it little style to my page so far everything I have read and tried has been unsuccessful. I have also been reading through Django&amp;rsquo;s documentation to try and get a better understanding of how to use the Django framework.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio Setup</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/second-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 15:46:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/second-blog/</guid><description>Today I added some content to my portfolio.
