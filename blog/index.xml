Once you get the shape that you want you can copy the CSS properties to your clipboard.
In my index.html file I have 3 sliders representing X, Y, and Z axis.

This program takes data from a database that contains information about speeding tickets that was recorded from a state trooper in the state of New York. This program makes a Ajax request returns the data then displays the data on 2 different pages one page has all the tickets and the other page only has the tickets that are 25 mph or over.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Prototype</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-fourth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 19:17:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-fourth/</guid><description>Today I learned about the prototype property in JavaScript. The prototype property allows you to add functionality or a certain property to an object that will then be added to all other objects of the same type.
If I create a class:
class userCreator{ constructor(name, score){ this.name = name; this.score = score; } } I can then add a method to the class like this:
userCreator.prototype.increment = function(){ this.score++; } Now if I create a new user:</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Program 4</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-third/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:48:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-third/</guid><description>Today I was able to finish the fourth JavaScript program of the semester. In this program we had to use DOM manipulation to create a table element to display data on the page. This program used Bootstrap 5 to help with styling the table. I used the window.onload() function to ensure everything was loading on the page before any JavaScript was able to run. I have an array of items.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Built-In Functions</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-second/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 14:18:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-second/</guid><description>I have been going through a course called Mastering the Coding Interview: Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms. I have learned a lot so far through this course. One thing I resently learned is, if I have two arrays and want to find out if I have a value from array1 that is the same in array2 I could loop through both arrays like this:
const array1 = [&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;x&amp;#39;]; const array2 = [&amp;#39;z&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;y&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;x&amp;#39;]; function containsCommonItem(arr1, arr2){ for(let i=0; i &amp;lt; arr1.</description></item><item><title>Python Fundamentals and Map()</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-first/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 19:22:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirty-first/</guid><description>I have been going back over some of the fundamentals of python data types and also trying to learn more advanced algorithms. Today I focused on the map() function. Map takes in 2 arguments like this map(function, iterables). So I could write a function like this:
def multiplyByTwo(item): return item*2 And then print the answer out like this:
print(list(map(multiplyByTwo, [2, 4, 6]))) which returns:
[4, 8, 12] This is a very basic example.</description></item><item><title>Exception Handling in C#</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirtyieth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 08:27:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirtyieth/</guid><description>I have been busy with my classes in school lately. It has been awhile since I have been able to write in my blog. Some things that I have been stuck on is how to write the logic for handling exceptions in my C# program. I have a Swimming Temperature program that has a SwimmingWaterTemperature class. In the class there is a public static bool CheckComfort(int temp) method that takes in an int sent from the users input and checks the temperature (returns true or false).</description></item><item><title>SQL Server + Visual Studio</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-ninth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 08:40:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-ninth/</guid><description>I have been learning more about C# and Visual Studio now that school has started back up. I started working on a ASP.Net Web app which I needed to connect to a database. Since it is .NET I decided to use SQL Server + SQL Server Studio, because that is what is recommended in the documentation for building a ASP.Net application. I was able to get the server setup, create a database model in my app, and pull data from the database and display it on the webpage.</description></item><item><title>filter function</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-eighth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 20:33:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-eighth/</guid><description>Today I learned about the filter function in JavaScript. This really is a super useful tool to use. Say I have an array of companies.
const companies = [ { name: &amp;#34;Company One&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Finance&amp;#34;, start: 1981, end: 2003 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Two&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Retail&amp;#34;, start: 1992, end: 2008 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Three&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Auto&amp;#34;, start: 1999, end: 2007 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Four&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Retail&amp;#34;, start: 1989, end: 2010 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Five&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Technology&amp;#34;, start: 2009, end: 2014 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Six&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Finance&amp;#34;, start: 1987, end: 2010 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Seven&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Auto&amp;#34;, start: 1986, end: 1996 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Eight&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Technology&amp;#34;, start: 2011, end: 2016 }, { name: &amp;#34;Company Nine&amp;#34;, category: &amp;#34;Retail&amp;#34;, start: 1981, end: 1989 } ]; I would like to get all the companies which category is Auto.</description></item><item><title>Protecting passwords in a repository</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-seventh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 11:47:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-seventh/</guid><description>Today I finished watching a tutorial on php and learned how to setup a database and server with xampp. I had to figure out on my own how to change ports on the database because port 3306 was already in use. I was able to go into the config file and make my changes and successfully connect to the database. I was also able to take the advice of my mentor and create a .</description></item><item><title>JavaScript and Security Fundamentals</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-sixth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 15:19:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-sixth/</guid><description>Today in my security fundamentals class, I learned about Organizational Units in Active Directory. I learned how to create groups of users and limit how long and what computer on the network they was able to use. This utilizes the Principle of Least Privledge approach. Only letting users have access to what is needed to complete the job.
I also learned how to use the XMLHttpRequest() method in JavaScript to pull data in from an API.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript map() function</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fifth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 19:05:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fifth/</guid><description>Today I learned about the JavaScript map() function. The map function is an important concept to learn if you want to master JavaScript. The map function works by mapping all elements in an array to a callback function and returns the results in an array. Here is an example of the map function:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const doubled = numbers.map(x =&amp;gt; x * 2); console.log(doubled); // returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Objects &amp; Prototypes</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fourth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 13:45:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-fourth/</guid><description>Today I learned about JavaScript Objects &amp;amp; Prototypes. For intance if I create an object constructor like this:
function Student(firstName, lastName, id, scores){ *** constructor body goes here *** } I can create a method and add it to the objects prototype, so any object of that type would be able to use that method like so:
Student.prototype.getAverage = function(){ *** Function body goes here *** } I really like learning JavaScript, although I know I have just scratched the surface with what the language is capable of.</description></item><item><title>Helping Others</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-third/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 08:00:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-third/</guid><description>I recently have been more active on Discord and what all the developers on twitter call &amp;ldquo;tech twitter&amp;rdquo;. I found a Discord server for my school. Some students on there were asking for help with their programs and web pages. I decided to reach out to them and offer help. It really opened my eyes and helped me realize just how far I have come in my coding journey. One person had their paragraph element inside their description topic elements like this &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Topic Here&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt; and the lab would not accept the code.</description></item><item><title>Sales Transaction C#, Writing 101</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-second/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 20:06:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-second/</guid><description>I was able to get finally get the lab to accept my code. I learned how to create classes in C#, overload operators, and to have overloaded constructors. So far this chapter and set of labs have been the hardest and most challenging ones I have had. I have been working with Carol on editing my essay for my writing 101 class which is due on 9/10/22, writing is not one of my strengths.</description></item><item><title>C# Problems and Writing 101</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-first-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 21:52:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twenty-first-blog/</guid><description>I have been working on my essay in my writing 101 class, and Carol has been helping me alot on editing. I really have a long way to go on getting good at writing. My C# class has really gotten difficult all the sudden. I am having trouble with implementing operator overloading in one of my problems. For some reason I just can not get solve this problem. Hopefully after a good nights sleep it will come to me.</description></item><item><title>C# and JavaScript Learning</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twentieth-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:47:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/twentieth-blog/</guid><description>Today I was able to write a C# program using ref keyword in my Reverse4 method. This method takes in 4 parameters, all passing by reference, then reverses the order of the numbers. The program demostrates the ability of the ref keyword to make possible passing a reference of the memory location of the variable and actually changing the value of the original variable from the method. I was also able to debug a program that was using the out keyword and find and correct all logic and syntax errors.</description></item><item><title>Javascript sort function</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/nineteenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 16:37:14 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/nineteenth-blog/</guid><description>Today I learned about the javascript sort() function. It really acts weird when sorting an array with numbers that have more than one digit. It only sorts the first digit. For instance 100 would come befor 23. The way around this behavior is to pass a function to the sort() function. So it would look like this: val = numbers.sort(function(a, b) { return a - b; }); and it would sort the numbers from lowest to highest.</description></item><item><title>Heroku disappointment</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eighteenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 19:06:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/eighteenth-blog/</guid><description>Heroku has decided to cancel their free tier service. This is very disappointing because I have apps hosted on their service. Because I am in school full time I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to pay for a new service. I will be trying to migrate my apps to a new free platform soon, many people have shared a lot of good options for this.
I have learned how open two files at the same time using python with open(&amp;quot;file1.</description></item><item><title>timer functions</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/seventeenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 20:59:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/seventeenth-blog/</guid><description>Today I used python timer module to run process_time() on my dictionary api request. I solved the same problem two different ways. One way using an list and the other using a set. I found the set way to be faster. After thinking about why I can see that a set should be faster because it uses hash tables and time shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the set is bigger or smaller. With a list the bigger the list is the longer it will take if you have to search through it.</description></item><item><title>Branching Out and Solving Problems</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/sixteenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 19:11:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/sixteenth-blog/</guid><description>Today I was able make make a request to a dictionary api to solve a problem in which I needed to find all the words that when spelled backwards are also acceptable scrabble words. Carol gave me the idea of the api during our meeting yesterday. Sometimes I have found you either need to walk away from the problem and sleep on it or get a fresh pair of eyes to help you solve it.</description></item><item><title>First week check-in</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fifteeth-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 15:02:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fifteeth-blog/</guid><description>After the first week of being back to school, I have been able to get an idea of how the semester is going to go. I think it will go smooth, except for my writing class, which is a bunch of writing essays. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will fail because I am not a terrible writer, but I am not the best writer either. I really like my Javascript and C# classes.</description></item><item><title>First week of School</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fourtenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 12:51:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/fourtenth-blog/</guid><description>So far this week has been very frustrating. HP sent out a firmware update that makes you use brand new ink cartridges from them or your computer will not print. So basically I have a bunch of refurbished ink catridges I can&amp;rsquo;t use and a printer I need and can&amp;rsquo;t use. I was not able to get into 2 of my classes for two days because they are switching systems so it crashed a few things but it will all work out it just has been a mesh this week.</description></item><item><title>Summers Over</title><link>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirtenth-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 19:48:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kquiggins.github.io/hugo_blog/blog/thirtenth-blog/</guid><description>Summer is finally over and it is time to go back to having deadlines and grade on programs.
